# Z80 Assembly extension for Visual Studio Code
The **Z80 Assembly** extension, developed for *Visual Studio Code*, is a simple extension that provides two possible color themes (one light and one dark) and a simple error detector for the *.s* and *.asm* files.
It fully supports the Z80 Assembly language.

I recommend using one of the two color themes provided by this extension while developing in Assembly to take advantage of all its features (which other themes may not support). Remember that the *Z80 Assembly Color Themes* are designed to support only the Z80 Assembly language.
